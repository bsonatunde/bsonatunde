### Description
I’m a Full Stack Developer with over three years of experience building scalable, user-friendly web and mobile applications. I work confidently across both frontend and backend technologies, using React.js, Node.js, and modern CSS frameworks to develop responsive and efficient solutions. I also build cross-platform mobile applications with React Native.

Some of the key projects I’ve worked on include the Pacey School Software Solution, a comprehensive system designed to help schools in Nigeria manage student and staff data efficiently, and Bird Feather, a mobile application built with React Native focused on delivering a smooth and engaging user experience. In these projects, I contributed to both the design and development process, ensuring strong performance, usability, and practical problem-solving.
